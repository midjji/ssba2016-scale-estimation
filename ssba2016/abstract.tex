Although popular in many applications, a monocular setup cannot recover the travel distance or translation scale without the use of contextual information or fusion with other sensors. Stereo provides a simple solution at the cost of two cameras but does so without a corresponding increasing of the field of view. However, under certain motion conditions, scale is observable with a non-overlapping pair of cameras mounted in a rigid frame. This provides the benefit of metric reconstructions and fully exploits the increased field of view across two cameras. We present an implementation of a method for recovering the relative pose including translation scale when such a camera pair is used. We also discuss the degenerate cases and provide a quality measure of the estimated scale.
